"This library is the websockets of the '90s" - Somebody at Hacker News.

- LZWEncoder.java
- NeuQuant.java

were taken from this website: [http://www.fmsware.com/stuff/gif.html](http://www.fmsware.com/stuff/gif.html).

## CREDITS

I've stole this idea (ehem, took inspiration) from a [chat](http://zesty.ca/chat/) a colleague showed me like three years ago. It wasn't open source back then and I was always wondering how to implement something like that. So kudos to Ka-Ping Yee, who had the original idea.

Thanks [simonw](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) for posting the link to the original chat.
